<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlorine Resistant Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Spinning Method</li><li>Wet Spinning Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chlorine resistant fiber is essential in swimwear and sports apparel, designed to withstand exposure to chlorine in pools. The market is primarily divided based on production methods: the dry spinning method involves dissolving polymer in a solvent, then extruding it into warm air, creating strong, fine fibers. In contrast, the wet spinning method uses a liquid coagulation bath to solidify the fiber, resulting in a more flexible and softer material. Both methods contribute to the performance and durability of chlorine resistant textiles.</p></p>

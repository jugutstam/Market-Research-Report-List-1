<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anaesthesia Vaporizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plenum Vaporizers</li><li>Drawover Vaporizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anesthetic vaporizer market comprises two main types: plenum vaporizers and drawover vaporizers. Plenum vaporizers utilize a fresh gas flow to mix anesthetic vapors, ensuring precise concentration delivery to patients. They are typically integrated into modern anesthesia machines. In contrast, drawover vaporizers rely on the patient's inspiratory flow to draw anesthetic vapor into the breathing circuit, allowing for simpler setups, often used in low-resource settings. Both types play crucial roles in delivering safe anesthesia during medical procedures.</p></p>
